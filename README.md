# Our joint project with dljubyvyj for ukode: Race01.
The essence of this project is to develop an algorithm for decryption. The program accepts a corket value, which is encrypted with the special character ? and depending on this, the necessary parameter does not go, selecting them from among the possible ones. The algorithm reminds you all of the familiar brute force, but for good purposes - encryption and data protection.

![Encryption-vs-Decryption](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95318722/191483143-45870c1e-a4d2-4b40-987a-eb37b2fe66e6.jpg)

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into cipher text, i.e. converting the text from readable format to nonreadable format to secure the conversation between two parties or from the unauthorized person; on the other hand, Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext into plain text, i.e. converting the non-readable text into readable text which anyone can understand. Both methods use secret keys to perform desired operations.

#### Cubes and a pyramid - we all love these interesting geometric shapes, let's look at their representation in the console, with a conditional 3D understanding.
### This is a cube whose size is 4 n.

### This is a cube whose size is 32 n.

### This is a pyramid whose size is 6 n.

#### Such a pseudo-representation of the world in three dimensions is a formality for us, because it becomes such only during rotation, therefore now we see only a 2D plane, of course, everything will change if it is not a console, but some kind of environment for displaying 3D graphics.
